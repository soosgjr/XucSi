  <b><font size="5">Alterations</font></b>
  <blockquote>This is the development version of Secret of Ultimate Legendary Fantasy: Unleashed, complete with source code.  I hereby grant all users permission to modify this game and to distribute derivative works, provided that the following conditions are met:</blockquote>
  <blockquote>1.  The title screen (WSPLASH), main menu (WMAIN), and "Be Nice" window (WMONEY) must remain intact and unchanged.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>2.  The disclaimer and distribution text above must be included and abided by.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>3.  This manual must be included.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>4.  The high standard of quality must be maintained.  Official-ish releases should be voted on by members of the Official-ish forum, and the virtue system should be expanded.  It must always change for the better.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>5.  The NICEWARE system must remain working and enforced - no "work arounds" may be made.  In order to access all character classes, the player must type "I SWEAR I DID SOMETHING NICE" one time per session.</blockquote>

  <b><font size="5">How to Play</font></b>
  <blockquote>SoulFu allows up to four players to play simultaneously, and USB Joysticks are recommended.  Before starting, you must setup controls for each player.  You'll figure it out!  There are some things worth mentioning, however...</blockquote>
  <blockquote>1.  This game is designed to be quick to play.  There is no save, F9 pauses.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>2.  Characters will slowly starve.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>3.  Most levels are randomly generated.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>4.  Hold the inventory button down and press other buttons to do "stuff".</blockquote>
  <blockquote>5.  Light damage is easy to heal, heavy wounds are not.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>6.  Enchantments tap mana, making it unavailable for other uses.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>7.  The castle still needs some work.  In the training room, jump on the post to hire helpers.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>8.  High-level characters must be virtuous.</blockquote>

  <b><font size="5">Frequently Asked Questions</font></b>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Do you have T-Shirts and other merchandise for sale?</b><br>A: Yup!  Original artwork too!  Check out <a href="http://www.aaronbishopgames.com">www.AaronBishopGames.com</a> to see it all.<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Why does it run so SLOW?</b><br>A: Try setting your display properties to "High Color (16 bit)"...  Right click an empty spot on the desktop, then select properties, then click the settings tab...  Pick "High Color (16 bit)" from the list...  Don't ask me why...  Also change the in-game settings to 640x480, 16 bit color, full screen...<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Why is it STILL SLOW?</b><br>A: Turn off Pretty Shadows, or you might want to try "Color Depth: 24 bit" (in the game settings menu), since some cards don't support a stencil buffer in other modes (and a stencil buffer is needed to do Pretty Shadows).<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: STILL SLOW...</b><br>A: Try turning off all the little checkmarks in the game's Settings window...  If that doesn't work, it may be that your graphics card doesn't support OpenGL very well...  You could try updating the drivers for your graphics card...  Or you could try GLDirect from SciTech...  Or you could try fiddling with the settings a bit more...  Or you could just give up...<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: How do you pronounce G'nome and D'warf?</b><br>A: Guh-Nome and Dee-Warf, of course...<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Have you written any other games?</b><br>A: The last game I wrote was called Egoboo (that one's Ee-Go-Boo, in case you're wondering)...  I did write a few others, but they're not really worth bothering with...<br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Do you plan to write any more games?</b><br>A: No.</i><br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: Do you want a job?</b><br>A: Maybe.</i><br></blockquote>
  <blockquote><b>Q: How can I contact you?</b><br>A: Send an email to <a href="mailto:aaron@aaronbishopgames.com">aaron@aaronbishopgames.com</a> -- I am removing myself from this project, however, so there's no guarantee that I'll answer...</i><br></blockquote>
